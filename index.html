        Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade
        career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture.
        The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie,
        Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in
        1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall.
